%====================================== Editorial Comments ============================================

\section{Editorial Comments}

\paragraph{Senior Editor} The 3 reviewers and the Associate Editor have identified both merits and issues with the paper. A "major revision" would be recommended.

\paragraph{Associate Editor} The paper received three reviews. While all reviewers acknowledged its potential impact on large-scale dataset clustering, several concerns remain and should be addressed in a revised versionâ€”specifically, the lack of validation beyond text datasets, insufficient theoretical justification, limited hyper-parameter analysis, and inadequate discussion of related work.

\AR{We thank the editorial team for their comprehensive assessment. We have systematically addressed each identified concern through substantial manuscript revisions, including multi-domain experimental validation, enhanced theoretical foundations with complete proofs, comprehensive parameter sensitivity analysis, and expanded related work covering medical image analysis applications.}

%====================================== Reviewer 1 ============================================

\section{Reviewer \#1}

\RC{The manuscript presents a novel framework, DiMergeCo, for scalable co-clustering of large-scale datasets, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation. The work is well-structured, methodologically sound, and addresses a significant gap in the field of co-clustering by improving computational efficiency and scalability. However, some revisions are required to enhance clarity, broaden the discussion of applications.}

\AR{We sincerely thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our contribution. We have addressed all the suggested revisions as outlined in the responses below.}

\RC{1. The probabilistic partitioning assumes co-clusters exceed a certain size for preservation with high probability. However, real-world data may contain small co-clusters that could be fragmented. Please discuss how DiMergeCo addresses this or provide guidance on parameter settings to detect smaller co-clusters effectively.}

\AR{Small co-clusters present unique challenges in partition-based approaches, and DiMergeCo implements coordinated strategies specifically designed to address these challenges while maintaining statistical rigor.}

\paragraph{Challenges in Small Co-cluster Detection and Our Corresponding Solutions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Challenge 1: High Fragmentation Risk
        Small co-clusters are highly vulnerable to being split across block boundaries due to their limited spatial extent, leading to complete pattern loss during partitioning.

  \item Challenge 2: Low Statistical Power
        Small co-clusters have inherently weak statistical signals, making them difficult to distinguish from noise and prone to detection failure in single partitioning attempts.

  \item Challenge 3: Insufficient Local Evidence
        Even when partially preserved, small co-cluster fragments may fall below local detection thresholds within individual blocks.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Our Coordinated Solutions}

\paragraph{Solution 1: Adaptive Block Sizing Protection}
To address the spatial fragmentation risk, \Cref{alg:partitioning} dynamically adjusts block dimensions to accommodate detected small co-clusters:
\begin{equation}
  \phi_i \leftarrow \max\left(\phi_i, \left\lceil\frac{M^{(k)}T_m}{Ms^{(k)}}\right\rceil\right)
\end{equation}
This adaptive mechanism specifically protects small co-clusters by ensuring that once detected, the surrounding blocks are enlarged proportionally to their size, preventing spatial fragmentation.

\paragraph{Solution 2: Multi-Sampling Protection}
To overcome the low statistical detection power, our probabilistic model provides exponential protection specifically targeting small co-clusters through repeated sampling iterations:
\begin{equation}
  P(\text{preserve small co-cluster}) = 1 - \left(1 - P_{\text{single}}\right)^{T_p}
\end{equation}
For small co-clusters with $P_{\text{single}} = 0.2$ (representing challenging detection scenarios), our multi-sampling achieves $67.2\%$ preservation with $T_p = 5$ and $89.3\%$ with $T_p = 10$, directly compensating for their low statistical power.

\paragraph{Solution 3: Cross-Block Fragment Reconstruction}
Our hierarchical merging specifically targets small co-cluster reconstruction by identifying and combining fragments across block boundaries, ensuring no small pattern is lost due to partitioning artifacts.

\paragraph{Hierarchical Merging for Cross-Block Co-cluster Reconstruction}
Our hierarchical merging strategy primarily addresses the reconstruction of larger co-clusters that may span multiple blocks, but also benefits small co-cluster detection by consolidating fragments that exceed our significance thresholds. The overlap threshold $\tau$ enables identification and merger of co-cluster pieces across block boundaries, ensuring comprehensive pattern recovery.

\paragraph{Experimental Validation on Small Co-cluster Detection}
We conducted controlled experiments on synthetic $5000 \times 5000$ matrices with planted co-clusters ranging from $5 \times 5$ to $20 \times 20$ (with minimum detection thresholds $T_m = T_n = 5$) to validate our approach to small co-cluster handling:

  \caption{Small co-cluster detection results demonstrating DiMergeCo's balanced approach to small pattern preservation and noise filtering.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Statistical Significance Analysis}
Our experimental results reveal an important insight: DiMergeCo's selective approach to small co-cluster preservation actually improves overall clustering quality. We observed that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Noise Filtering Benefit:} Our thresholding mechanism provides a principled approach to balance between preserving meaningful small co-clusters and avoiding false positives from noise
  \item \textbf{Statistical Robustness:} For $5 \times 5$ patterns near the noise threshold, DiMergeCo shows more conservative but statistically sound detection rates
  \item \textbf{Meaningful Pattern Preservation:} For $10 \times 10$ and larger patterns with clear statistical significance, DiMergeCo approaches or matches centralized method performance
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Scalability Advantage for Small Co-clusters}
Importantly, DiMergeCo enables small co-cluster detection on datasets where traditional methods like SCC fail entirely due to computational constraints. For $20 \times 20$ co-clusters, DiMergeCo-SCC achieves NMI=0.74 and ARI=0.62, closely matching SCC's performance (NMI=0.76, ARI=0.68) while providing distributed processing capabilities that SCC lacks.

\paragraph{Parameter Guidelines for Small Co-cluster Detection}
Based on our sensitivity analysis, we recommend the following parameter settings for balanced small co-cluster detection:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Minimum thresholds:} Set $T_m = T_n$ to $50\%$ of expected smallest \emph{meaningful} co-cluster size
  \item \textbf{Sampling iterations:} Use $T_p \geq 10$ for datasets containing small co-clusters
  \item \textbf{Block configuration:} Maintain block sizes $\geq 3 \times$ minimum co-cluster size to reduce fragmentation risk
  \item \textbf{Statistical significance:} Prefer slightly higher thresholds over aggressive micro-pattern detection to improve overall clustering quality
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Theoretical Limitations and Practical Advantages}
We acknowledge that extremely small co-clusters (e.g., $< 5 \times 5$) pose fundamental challenges for any partitioning-based approach. However, our experimental analysis suggests that this limitation often represents an advantage: such micro-patterns frequently represent noise rather than meaningful structure in large-scale applications. Our coordinated strategies effectively balance small co-cluster preservation with noise filtering, leading to improved overall clustering quality on massive datasets.

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

We enhanced our contribution statement to emphasize the adaptive preservation mechanism:

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Theoretically-Guaranteed Probabilistic Partitioning:} We introduce the first matrix partitioning algorithm specifically designed for co-cluster preservation, fundamentally different from existing uniform or load-based partitioning methods. Our algorithm adaptively determines partition configurations and sampling iterations based on co-cluster characteristics. This adaptive mechanism provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for preserving co-clusters of varying sizes, enabling reliable decomposition of global co-clustering into independent local problems.
\end{quote}

We added a new subsection in~\Cref{sec:experiment} "Small Co-cluster Detection Analysis":

\begin{quote}
  To validate small co-cluster preservation, we conducted controlled experiments on synthetic $5000 \times 5000$ matrices with planted co-clusters ranging from $5 \times 5$ to $20 \times 20$ with minimum thresholds $T_m = T_n = 5$. As demonstrated in~\Cref{fig:small-co-cluster-detection}, DiMergeCo-SCC consistently outperforms NMTF and PNMTF across all co-cluster sizes, confirming that the proposed multi-sampling, adaptive sizing, and merging mechanisms effectively protect small co-clusters from fragmentation. Notably, for $20 \times 20$ co-clusters, it achieves NMI=0.74 and ARI=0.62, closely matching SCC's performance (NMI=0.76, ARI=0.68) while offering distributed processing capabilities that SCC lacks. This empirically validates our theoretical guarantees and supports DiMergeCo's applicability to real-world datasets where small co-clusters are common.
\end{quote}

We also enhanced~\Cref{subsec:practical-implementation} with clarification of the coordinated protection mechanisms:

\begin{quote}
  The algorithm achieves reliable co-cluster preservation through three complementary mechanisms: (1) probabilistic bounds ensuring exponential protection through multi-sampling, (2) adaptive block sizing that expands dimensions for important co-clusters, and (3) hierarchical merging that reconstructs fragments across block boundaries. Together, these mechanisms provide robust protection against co-cluster fragmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for large-scale applications.
\end{quote}

\RC{2. The method relies on parameters such as block sizes ($\phi_i$, $\psi_i$), thresholds ($T_m$, $T_n$), and the probability threshold ($P_\text{thresh}$). The manuscript lacks discussion on how to select these parameters or their impact on performance. Please include an analysis of parameter sensitivity and practical guidelines for their tuning.}

\AR{The parameter analysis has been added to the revised manuscript following the reviewer's suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduced a new subsection, \emph{Parameter Sensitivity Analysis} (\Cref{subsec:param-sensitivity}), which systematically varies the three key parameters on the CLASSIC4 dataset.
  \item Added~\Cref{tab:param_sens} that reports NMI, ARI, and runtime across 36 different parameter combinations. The study reveals that co-cluster size thresholds have the most significant impact on quality, with $T_m=T_n=20$ achieving optimal performance (NMI=0.776, ARI=0.590). The configuration with 100 blocks provides the best runtime-quality trade-off, being approximately $55\%$ faster than 25 blocks while maintaining superior clustering accuracy.
  \item Provided evidence-based practical guidelines that recommend: (i) 100 blocks for optimal parallelization, (ii) $T_m=T_n=20$ for balanced noise filtering, and (iii) $P_{\text{thresh}}=0.95$ for efficient reliability-speed balance.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

\begin{quote}
  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:param-sensitivity} Parameter Sensitivity Analysis}

  To evaluate the influence of key parameters on both clustering quality and computational efficiency, we conducted a detailed ablation study on the \textbf{CLASSIC4} dataset. Specifically, we examined the effects of three parameters: (i) the number of blocks in the layout, with square configurations $m \times n \in \{25, 64, 100, 144\}$; (ii) the minimum co-cluster size thresholds, $T_m = T_n \in \{10, 20, 30\}$; and (iii) the detection probability threshold, $P_{\text{thresh}} \in \{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$. Each configuration was evaluated using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and wall-clock runtime. All reported results are averaged over three independent runs for consistency.

  \paragraph{Sensitivity Results}
  \Cref{tab:param_sens} presents the full set of results, with optimal values highlighted in \textbf{bold}. Our analysis shows that the minimum co-cluster size threshold has the most significant effect on clustering quality. A low threshold ($T_m = T_n = 10$) leads to the formation of noisy and irrelevant micro-clusters, resulting in degraded performance (NMI $\approx$ 0.746--0.766). Conversely, a high threshold ($T_m = T_n = 30$) filters out too many valid small co-clusters, leading to under-segmentation and reduced accuracy (NMI $\approx$ 0.733--0.753). The intermediate value ($T_m = T_n = 20$) offers the best trade-off, consistently achieving superior performance (NMI $\approx$ 0.756--0.778) by balancing noise suppression with structure preservation.

  The block configuration primarily affects runtime rather than clustering quality. With only 25 blocks, limited parallelism causes prolonged runtimes (7,456--11,890 seconds). Increasing the number of blocks to 100 significantly reduces runtime (3,234--6,234 seconds) by improving parallel efficiency without substantial communication overhead. However, further increasing to 144 blocks results in higher overhead from inter-block communication, which offsets the parallelization gains and increases the runtime again.

  The detection probability threshold, $P_{\text{thresh}}$, has a relatively minor impact on clustering quality but a noticeable effect on runtime. Raising the threshold from 0.90 to 0.99 yields only marginal NMI improvements (typically 0.002--0.005), but incurs a substantial increase in runtime (30--70\%). This suggests that while higher thresholds may slightly enhance reliability, they do so at a disproportionately high computational cost.

  \paragraph{Recommendations}
  Based on our empirical findings, we propose the following parameter settings for an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block configuration:} Use a square $10 \times 10$ layout (100 blocks), which minimizes runtime without compromising clustering quality.
    \item \textbf{Minimum co-cluster size:} Set $T_m = T_n = 20$ to effectively filter noise while preserving meaningful co-cluster structures, consistently yielding the highest NMI and ARI values.
    \item \textbf{Detection probability threshold:} Use $P_{\text{thresh}} = 0.95$ to achieve strong clustering reliability with a reasonable computational cost. Increasing to 0.99 offers minimal performance gains (less than 0.5\%) at the expense of significantly longer runtimes.
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\RC{3. The paper claims applicability to recommendation systems, gene expression analysis, and document clustering, but the experiments focus primarily on text datasets. To substantiate broader applicability, please include experiments on datasets from other domains.}

\AR{In the revised manuscript, we have significantly expanded our experimental section to include new datasets from additional real-world domains beyond text analysis:}

\paragraph{Multi-Domain Experimental Enhancement}

Our revised experiments now demonstrate effectiveness across three major application domains:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Document Clustering:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item CLASSIC4 and RCV1-Large datasets validate traditional text mining applications
          \item Results demonstrate effectiveness for high-dimensional sparse text matrices
        \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Recommendation Systems:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Amazon dataset containing 123,321 users and 23,379 products demonstrates applicability to user-item interaction matrices
          \item This represents a fundamentally different matrix structure from text data, with distinct sparsity patterns and co-cluster semantics
          \item Results show superior performance (NMI: 0.7676, ARI: 0.5845) compared to existing methods
        \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Genomics and Bioinformatics:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset with 130 samples and 11,731 genes after preprocessing
          \item Validates applicability to gene expression analysis where co-clusters represent gene regulatory modules and patient stratification
          \item Achieves exceptional performance (NMI: 0.8237, ARI: 0.7403) while maintaining computational efficiency (847.5 seconds)
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Cross-Domain Theoretical Validation}

Our theoretical framework proves domain-agnostic because:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Matrix partitioning preserves low-rank structures regardless of data semantics (\Cref{thm:rank-monotonicity})
  \item Probabilistic preservation bounds apply universally to any co-cluster detection problem (\Cref{thm:probability-co-cluster-detection})
  \item The method operates as a matrix-agnostic framework where algorithmic guarantees transfer across domains
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Practical Domain Adaptations}

Each domain demonstrates different matrix characteristics that validate our method's robustness:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Text Data:} High sparsity (0.08--0.95\%), document-term relationships
  \item \textbf{Recommendation Systems:} User-product interactions, implicit feedback patterns
  \item \textbf{Gene Expression:} High-dimensional biological networks, sample-gene associations
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

We enhanced \Cref{tab:dataset-statistics} to include the Breast Cancer dataset with detailed genomics characteristics and preprocessing information.

We clarified the dataset descriptions in \Cref{subsec:datasets} to emphasize domain diversity:

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Amazon}: A medium-sized recommendation system dataset containing user-product interaction matrices with 123,321 users and 23,379 products, demonstrating applicability beyond text data to recommendation systems.
\end{quote}

We added domain-specific analysis in \Cref{subsec:clustering-quality} for genomics applications:

\begin{quote}
  Particularly impressive is its performance on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (NMI: 0.8237, ARI: 0.7403), significantly outperforming PNMTF and ONMTF. This success stems from our probabilistic partitioning strategy and hierarchical merging process, which effectively preserve gene regulatory modules and reconstruct meaningful gene-sample associations. The method's computational efficiency (847.5 seconds) and ability to handle high-dimensional data (11,731 genes, 130 samples) make it particularly valuable for genomics applications.
\end{quote}

We updated \Cref{sec:conclusion} to emphasize cross-domain effectiveness:

\begin{quote}
  Experimental results on diverse datasets spanning text documents, recommendation systems, and gene expression data demonstrate substantial improvements in computational efficiency and scalability, confirming the method's effectiveness across different data types and scales.
\end{quote}

\RC{4. MPI Implementation Details: The manuscript states that the main node computes initial partitioning thresholds, but further details on data distribution and communication management during merging are lacking. Please elaborate on these aspects to enhance reproducibility.}

\AR{We appreciate the reviewer's feedback regarding MPI implementation details. To enhance reproducibility, we have substantially expanded \Cref{subsec:mpi-implementation} `Distributed MPI Implementation and Communication Framework' with implementation specifications that demonstrate how our theoretical framework translates to distributed computing while maintaining all co-cluster preservation guarantees.}

\paragraph{Data Distribution Strategy}
We provide detailed specifications for our three-phase distribution protocol that directly implements \Cref{alg:partitioning}: (1) computing optimal partitions with theoretical guarantees from \Cref{thm:probability-co-cluster-detection}, (2) distributing blocks via \texttt{MPI\_Scatter} with load balancing constraints, and (3) synchronizing parameters via \texttt{MPI\_Bcast} to ensure consistent execution across processors.

\paragraph{Communication Management During Merging}
The enhanced section describes our binary tree reduction protocol that achieves $O(\log P)$ communication complexity through $\lceil \log_2 P \rceil$-step merging operations. This hierarchical approach eliminates centralized bottlenecks while maintaining the theoretical co-cluster preservation properties established in our analysis.

\paragraph{Reproducibility Specifications}
We include essential system requirements, compilation instructions, and distributed execution guidelines that ensure the theoretical guarantees can be practically realized across different computing environments.

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

We have substantially enhanced \Cref{subsec:mpi-implementation} `Distributed MPI Implementation and Communication Framework' with comprehensive implementation details including:

\begin{quote}
  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:mpi-implementation} Distributed MPI Implementation and Communication Framework}
  To demonstrate the practical feasibility and scalability of our proposed distributed system, we implement DiMergeCo using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) with comprehensive protocols for data distribution, communication management, and fault tolerance. This implementation enables effective distribution of computational load across multiple nodes while maintaining theoretical guarantees for co-cluster preservation.
  \subsubsection*{\Cref{subsec:mpi-implementation} Data Distribution Protocol}
  The main node implements a three-phase protocol: (1) computing optimal partitions using \Cref{alg:partitioning} with theoretical guarantees from \Cref{thm:probability-co-cluster-detection}, (2) distributing blocks via \texttt{MPI\_Scatter} with load balancing, and (3) synchronizing parameters via \texttt{MPI\_Bcast}.

  \subsubsection*{\Cref{subsec:mpi-implementation} Hierarchical Communication Management}
  Our binary tree reduction achieves $O(\log P)$ communication complexity through $\lceil \log_2 P \rceil$-step merging using custom \texttt{MPI\_Reduce} operations, eliminating centralized bottlenecks while maintaining co-cluster preservation guarantees.
\end{quote}

\RC{5. In Related Work section, please analyze the application of co-clustering in different areas, for example, in the area of medical image analysis I suggest following papers: [References 1-5]}

\AR{Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We have added a new subsection~\Cref{subsec:medical-image-analysis} `Co-clustering Applications in Medical Image Analysis' in~\Cref{sec:related-work} that incorporates all five suggested papers.}

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

\begin{quote}
  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:medical-image-analysis} Co-clustering Applications in Medical Image Analysis}
  Co-clustering has proven effective in medical image analysis, particularly for tumor detection. In brain MR imaging, iterative spectral co-clustering achieves 99.12\% accuracy on BraTS2020\cite{farnoosh2024DevelopmentUnsupervisedPseudodeep}, while advanced approaches like MFARICIRD reach 99.98\% accuracy through dynamic parameter optimization\cite{farnoosh2025PseudodeepUnsupervisedModelbased}. The IMFADCC method demonstrates superior performance across BraTS2018-2020 by simultaneously optimizing row-column clusters\cite{farnoosh2024BrainMagneticResonance}. For mammography, EMFACCI segments images into tumor-containing blocks on MIAS and DDSM datasets\cite{farnoosh2024NovelApproachAutomatic}. Combined ICCK approaches achieve 84.87\% Dice coefficient on brain tumor detection\cite{farnoosh2022ApplicationModifiedCombinational}.

%====================================== Reviewer 2 ============================================

\section{Reviewer \#2}

\RC{This paper presents DiMergeCo, a novel approach to co-clustering that addresses scalability challenges through a divide-and-conquer strategy. The work makes valuable contributions to large-scale data analysis with theoretical guarantees. The experimental results are impressive, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods. However, some minor revisions are needed before the paper can be accepted.}

\AR{We sincerely thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our contribution. We have addressed all the suggested revisions as outlined in the responses below.}

\RC{1. A notation table should be added to improve readability, as was done in the conference version.}

\AR{Thank you for the suggestion. We have added a comprehensive notation table (\Cref{tab:notation}) that systematically organizes all mathematical symbols used in the paper into logical categories, making it easy for readers to reference unfamiliar notation.}

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

\Cref{tab:notation} now includes sections for Matrix Notation, Co-clustering Concepts, Partitioning Parameters, Algorithm Variables, and Implementation Details.

\RC{2. In \Cref{subsec:problem-statement}, there is a potential error where the authors state "computing and storing the similarity matrix requires $O(MN)$ memory." This should likely be $O(M^2)$ or $O(N^2)$. Please clarify.}

\AR{We sincerely thank the reviewer for this clarification request. In co-clustering context, our "similarity matrix" refers to the original data matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$, not traditional row-row ($M \times M$) or column-column ($N \times N$) similarity matrices.}

Co-clustering methods directly apply SVD to the $M \times N$ data matrix:
- Storage: $O(MN)$ for the data matrix itself
- Computation: $O(MN \cdot \min(M,N))$ for SVD on $M \times N$ matrix

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

\begin{quote}
  In particular, computing and storing the $M \times N$ data matrix requires $O(MN)$ memory, and performing the corresponding SVD on the $M \times N$ data matrix demands $\min\{M,N\}^2\,\max\{M,N\}$ computational operations.
\end{quote}


\RC{3. In \Cref{eq:co-clustering-objective}, the meanings of $L$, $x_{ij}$, and $u_{kl}$ need to be explicitly defined to ensure clarity.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this important observation and have modified the manuscript accordingly.}

\paragraph{Manuscript Modifications}

\begin{quote}
  Formally, the co-clustering objective seeks to partition the matrix A into K row clusters and L column clusters that minimize the reconstruction error:

  \begin{equation}
    J = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{i \in R_k} \sum_{j \in C_l} \| x_{ij} - u_{kl} \|^2,
  \end{equation}

  where $R_k$ denotes the k-th row cluster, $C_l$ denotes the l-th column cluster, $x_{ij}$ is the original matrix element, and $u_{kl}$ is the reconstructed value for co-cluster $(k,l)$.
\end{quote}

\RC{4. \Cref{fig:efficiency} references `efficiency' but does not specify how this metric is defined. Please provide a clear definition.}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We have added a clear mathematical definition in \Cref{subsec:scalability-analysis}.}

\section{Reviewer \#3}

\RC{The paper proposes DiMergeCo, a distributed and scalable co-clustering framework that partitions large matrices using a probabilistic scheme, performs local co-clustering, and merges results via a hierarchical strategy. Despite its engineering appeal, the paper falls short in key scientific aspects:}

\AR{We thank the reviewer for this constructive feedback. We have substantially enhanced our manuscript to address all the concerns raised by the reviewer.}

\RC{1. Most components (partitioning, merging, local NMTF) are adaptations of prior methods. The integration is useful but lacks algorithmic novelty.}

\AR{Our work introduces three fundamental algorithmic innovations that go far beyond simple adaptation of existing methods: (1) We develop the first theoretically-guaranteed probabilistic partitioning algorithm specifically designed for co-cluster preservation, fundamentally different from existing uniform or load-based partitioning methods, (2) We design a communication-optimal hierarchical merging strategy that eliminates centralized bottlenecks and reduces per-node communication complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$, and (3) We establish an integrated algorithmic framework with complete theoretical foundations providing the first rigorous analysis for distributed co-clustering performance guarantees. Each component represents a significant algorithmic advancement addressing fundamental challenges in large-scale co-clustering.}

\paragraph{Contribution 1: Theoretically-Guaranteed Probabilistic Partitioning}

Our probabilistic partitioning algorithm represents a fundamental departure from existing matrix partitioning approaches:

\textbf{Co-cluster Preservation Design:} Unlike existing uniform or load-based partitioning methods that ignore data structure, we introduce the first matrix partitioning algorithm specifically designed for co-cluster preservation. Our algorithm adaptively determines partition configurations and sampling iterations based on co-cluster characteristics, providing explicit probabilistic guarantees:
$$P \geq 1 - \exp\left\{-2T_p\left[\phi m (s^{(k)})^2 + \psi n (t^{(k)})^2\right]\right\}$$

\textbf{Adaptive Mechanism:} The core algorithmic innovation lies in our adaptive block sizing mechanism (Lines 8-9 of \Cref{alg:partitioning}) where partition sizes are dynamically determined by co-cluster density characteristics:
$$\phi_i \leftarrow \max\left(\phi_i, \left\lceil\frac{M^{(k)}T_m}{Ms^{(k)}}\right\rceil\right)$$

This adaptive mechanism provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for preserving co-clusters of varying sizes, enabling reliable decomposition of global co-clustering into independent local problemsâ€”a capability that existing partitioning methods fundamentally lack.

\paragraph{Contribution 2: Communication-Optimal Hierarchical Merging Strategy}

Our hierarchical merging strategy introduces fundamental architectural innovations for distributed coordination:

\textbf{Centralized Bottleneck Elimination:} We design a binary tree-based coordination algorithm that eliminates the centralized bottlenecks inherent in existing distributed co-clustering methods. Unlike prior approaches requiring centralized coordination or broadcast communication, our hierarchical strategy operates through peer-to-peer communication in $\lceil \log_2 P \rceil$ steps.

\textbf{Communication Complexity Reduction:} Our approach reduces per-node communication complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$ while providing theoretical convergence guarantees. This represents a fundamental architectural advancement for distributed co-clustering, enabling scalability to thousands of processing nodes.

\textbf{Theoretical Convergence Guarantees:} Our merging strategy maintains co-cluster preservation properties while providing bounded convergence in at most $K_0-1$ steps, where $K_0$ is the initial number of local co-clusters, ensuring predictable termination.

\paragraph{Contribution 3: Integrated Algorithmic Framework with Theoretical Foundations}

We establish the first complete theoretical framework for distributed co-clustering with rigorous performance guarantees:

\textbf{Global Optimality Bounds:} We establish a complete theoretical framework connecting local solution quality to global optimality bounds.

\textbf{First Rigorous Analysis:} Our framework provides the first rigorous analysis for distributed co-clustering performance guarantees, establishing theoretical bounds that span the entire distributed pipeline from partitioning through merging to final solution quality.

\textbf{Practical Implementation with Theoretical Guarantees:} Our MPI implementation demonstrates that these algorithmic innovations enable processing scales where existing methods fail due to computational limitations while achieving superior clustering quality and significant computational efficiency improvements. The theoretical framework guides practical parameter selection and ensures solution quality.

We revised \Cref{subsec:large-matrix-partitioning} to include the following:

\begin{quote}
  \subsubsection*{\Cref{subsec:large-matrix-partitioning} Probabilistic Model for Partitioning}

  To ensure theoretical rigor and facilitate reproducibility, we explicitly state all assumptions underlying our probabilistic partitioning framework:

  \begin{assumption*}[\Cref{assumption:random-partitioning} Random Partitioning]
    Partition boundaries are chosen uniformly at random, ensuring $E[X_{i,r}] = \phi_i/M$ for any row $r \in C_k$, where $X_{i,r}$ is the indicator that row $r$ falls in block $i$.
  \end{assumption*}

  \begin{assumption*}[\Cref{assumption:independence} Independence]
    Row and column partitioning processes are independent, allowing factorization of joint probabilities as shown in \Cref{eq:joint-probability}: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ for partition events.
  \end{assumption*}

  \begin{assumption*}[\Cref{assumption:co-cluster-coherence} Co-cluster Coherence]
    Each co-cluster $C_k$ exhibits uniform density within its support region, with density variation bounded by constant factor $\rho \leq 2$, justifying the low-rank approximation in \Cref{thm:low-rank-approximation}.
  \end{assumption*}

  \begin{assumption*}[\Cref{assumption:finite-co-cluster-set} Finite Co-cluster Set]
    The number of significant co-clusters $K$ is finite and bounded by $O(\min(M,N))$, ensuring algorithmic termination.
  \end{assumption*}

  \begin{assumption*}[\Cref{assumption:minimum-size-constraint} Minimum Size Constraint]
    All significant co-clusters satisfy $M^{(k)} \geq T_m$ and $N^{(k)} \geq T_n$ for meaningful detection thresholds.
  \end{assumption*}

  \begin{assumption*}[\Cref{assumption:sample-size-requirements} Sample Size Requirements]
    Our concentration inequalities require $\min(\phi_i, \psi_j) \geq \log^2(mn)$ for proper convergence, which is automatically satisfied in our experimental settings.
  \end{assumption*}


  \begin{lemma*}[Joint Probability of Co-cluster Size]
    Let $C_k$ be a co-cluster and $B_{(i,j)}$ be a block in the partitioned matrix. The probability that the size of the co-cluster $C_k$ within block $B_{(i,j)}$ is less than $T_m$ rows and $T_n$ columns is given by:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} & < T_m, N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n)                                         \\
                          & \leq \exp\left[-2 (s_i^{(k)})^2 \phi_i -2 (t_j^{(k)})^2 \psi_j\right]
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    where $s_i^{(k)} = \cfrac{M^{(k)}}{M} - \cfrac{T_m-1}{\phi_i}$ and $t_j^{(k)} = \cfrac{N^{(k)}}{N} - \cfrac{T_n-1}{\psi_j}$.
  \end{lemma*}


  \begin{proof}
    Let $M_{(i,j)}^{(k)}$ be the number of rows of co-cluster $C_k$ that fall into the $i$-th row partition of size $\phi_i$. This can be modeled as a sum of $M^{(k)}$ independent Bernoulli random variables, where each variable indicates if a specific row of $C_k$ is in the partition. By \Cref{assumption:random-partitioning}, the probability of any given row falling into the $i$-th partition is $p = \phi_i / M$. The expected number of rows is $E[M_{(i,j)}^{(k)}] = M^{(k)} p = M^{(k)} \phi_i / M$.

    We are interested in the probability of this count being less than the threshold $T_m$. Applying Hoeffding's inequality to the sum of these Bernoulli variables, we get:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} & < T_m) = P\left(\frac{M_{(i,j)}^{(k)}}{M^{(k)}} < \frac{T_m}{M^{(k)}}\right)              \\
                          & \le \exp\left(-2 M^{(k)2} \left(\frac{\phi_i}{M} - \frac{T_m-1}{M^{(k)}}\right)^2 \right)
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    For simplicity in the main text, we use a slightly different formulation. Let $M_{(i,j)}^{(k)}$ be the sum of $\phi_i$ indicator variables (one for each row in the block), where the probability of a row being in $C_k$ is $M^{(k)}/M$. The expected value is $E[M_{(i,j)}^{(k)}] = \phi_i M^{(k)}/M$. The event of failure is $M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m$. By Hoeffding's inequality:
    \begin{equation}
      P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m) = P(\phi_i \frac{M^{(k)}}{M} - M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} > \phi_i \frac{M^{(k)}}{M} - T_m
    \end{equation}
    A symmetric argument holds for the columns:
    \begin{equation}
      P(N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n) \le \exp(-2 \psi_j (t_j^{(k)})^2)
    \end{equation}
    By \Cref{assumption:independence}, the row and column partitioning events are independent. Therefore, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} & < T_m, N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n)                                      \\
                          & = P(M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m) \cdot P(N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n)          \\
                          & = \exp\left[-2 (s_i^{(k)})^2 \phi_i -2 (t_j^{(k)})^2 \psi_j\right]
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    which yields the stated bound by multiplying the exponential terms.
  \end{proof}


  \begin{theorem*}[Probability of Co-cluster Detection]
    If the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is partitioned into $m \times n$ blocks, each with sizes $\phi_i \times \psi_j$, the probability $P$ of detecting all $K$ significant co-clusters over $T_p$ independent partitioning trials satisfies:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P & \geq 1 - K \cdot \left(\prod_{i=1}^m \prod_{j=1}^n P_\text{fail}^{(i,j,k)}\right)^{T_p}                             \\
          & \approx 1 - K \cdot \exp\left( -2 T_p \sum_{i,j} \left[ (s_i^{(k)})^2 \phi_i + (t_j^{(k)})^2 \psi_j \right] \right)
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    Under the simplifying assumption of uniform block sizes $\phi = M/m, \psi=N/n$, this becomes:
    \begin{equation}
      P \geq 1 - K \cdot \exp \left\{ -2 T_p \left[ M (s^{(k)})^2 + N (t^{(k)})^2 \right] \right\}
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem*}


  \begin{proof}
    Let $\mathcal{F}_{k,t}$ be the event that co-cluster $C_k$ is missed in partition trial $t$. A co-cluster is missed if it is not detected in *any* of the $m \times n$ blocks. Detection in a block $(i,j)$ fails if its sub-cluster size is below the threshold, i.e., $M_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_m$ or $N_{(i,j)}^{(k)} < T_n$. For simplicity, we consider the stricter event from \Cref{thm:joint-probability} where both are below the threshold. The event $\mathcal{F}_{k,t}$ occurs if this holds for all blocks: $\mathcal{F}_{k,t} = \bigcap_{i=1}^m \bigcap_{j=1}^n \{\text{size in block }(i,j) < \text{threshold}\}$.

    Assuming independence of row/column placement across different block boundaries, the probability of this event is:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P(\mathcal{F}_{k,t}) & \le \prod_{i=1}^m \prod_{j=1}^n \exp\left[-2 (s_i^{(k)})^2 \phi_i -2 (t_j^{(k)})^2 \psi_j\right] \\
                             & = \exp\left( -2 \sum_{i,j} \left[ (s_i^{(k)})^2 \phi_i + (t_j^{(k)})^2 \psi_j \right] \right)
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    Let the exponent term be $\gamma_k$. Then $P(\mathcal{F}_{k,t}) \le \exp(-\gamma_k)$. Since each of the $T_p$ partitioning trials is independent, the probability of missing co-cluster $C_k$ in all $T_p$ trials is:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P(\text{miss } C_k \text{ in all } & T_p \text{ trials}) = (P(\mathcal{F}_{k,t}))^{T_p} \\
                                           & \le (\exp(-\gamma_k))^{T_p} = \exp(-\gamma_k T_p)
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    The probability of missing at least one of the $K$ co-clusters is found using the union bound (\Cref{assumption:finite-co-cluster-set}):
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned}
        P( & \text{miss any co-cluster}) = P\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^K \{\text{miss } C_k\}\right) \\
           & \le \sum_{k=1}^K P(\text{miss } C_k) \le \sum_{k=1}^K \exp(-\gamma_k T_p)
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    Assuming a minimum $\gamma = \min_k \gamma_k$, this is bounded by $K \exp(-\gamma T_p)$. The probability of success (detecting all co-clusters) is therefore:
    \begin{equation}
      P = 1 - P(\text{miss any co-cluster}) \ge 1 - K \exp(-\gamma T_p)
    \end{equation}
    Under the simplifying assumption of uniform block sizes $\phi=M/m, \psi=N/n$, and nearly constant $s_i^{(k)} \approx s^{(k)}, t_j^{(k)} \approx t^{(k)}$, the sum becomes $\sum_{i,j} \approx mn \left( (s^{(k)})^2 \phi + (t^{(k)})^2 \psi \right) = M (s^{(k)})^2 + N (t^{(k)})^2$, yielding the simplified bound in \Cref{eq:prob-of-identifying-all-co-clusters}.
  \end{proof}

And \Cref{sec:theoretical-foundations} to include the following:

\begin{quote}
  \section*{\Cref{sec:theoretical-foundations} Theoretical Analysis}
  The theoretical foundation of DiMergeCo rests on three pillars: (1) a probabilistic guarantee that co-clusters are preserved during partitioning, (2) a bound on the quality of the global solution relative to the true optimum, and (3) a proof of convergence for the hierarchical merging process. This section formalizes these guarantees, establishing the mathematical soundness of our framework.

  Throughout this section, we define the co-clustering quality using a general objective function $J(\mathcal{C})$, which measures the total reconstruction error for a set of co-clusters $\mathcal{C}$. For a specific block $(i,j)$, the local objective is denoted $J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)})$. A solution is $\epsilon$-suboptimal if its objective value is within $\epsilon$ of the optimal value.

  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:co-cluster-preservation-guarantee} Co-Cluster Preservation Guarantee}
  A primary risk in any divide-and-conquer approach is the potential loss of important structures that straddle partition boundaries. Our probabilistic partitioning algorithm (\Cref{subsec:large-matrix-partitioning}) is explicitly designed to mitigate this risk. As rigorously proven in \Cref{thm:probability-co-cluster-detection}, our method provides a strong probabilistic guarantee for co-cluster preservation.

  \begin{theorem*}[\Cref{thm:co-cluster-preservation} Co-Cluster Preservation, restated]
    For a set of $K$ significant co-clusters and $T_p$ independent random partitions, the probability of failing to capture any given co-cluster $C_k$ (i.e., having it fall below the size threshold in all blocks across all partitions) decreases exponentially with $T_p$. The probability of successfully detecting all $K$ co-clusters is bounded by:
    \begin{equation}
      P(\text{detect all}) \ge 1 - K \cdot \exp(-\gamma_{\min} T_p)
    \end{equation}
    where $\gamma_{\min} > 0$ is a constant determined by the co-cluster and partitioning parameters, as defined in the proof of \Cref{thm:probability-co-cluster-detection}.
  \end{theorem*}

  This theorem confirms that by performing a sufficient number of partitioning iterations $T_p$, we can make the probability of missing any significant co-cluster arbitrarily small. This guarantee is the cornerstone of our framework, as it ensures that the inputs to the local co-clustering stage are faithful representations of the global data structure.

  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:global-solution-quality-bound} Global Solution Quality Bound}
  After establishing that co-clusters are preserved in the partitioned blocks, we analyze how the quality of local solutions translates to the quality of the global solution. The following theorem bounds the error of the solution formed by the union of local results, showing it is close to the global optimum.

  \begin{theorem*}[\Cref{thm:global-solution-quality} Global Solution Quality]
    Let $\mathcal{C}^*$ be the globally optimal co-clustering solution for matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with objective value $J(\mathcal{C}^*)$. Let $\mathcal{C}_{union} = \bigcup_{i,j} \mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}$ be the set of co-clusters obtained by taking the union of all local solutions before merging. If each local solution $\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}$ is $\epsilon_{(i,j)}$-suboptimal for its respective block $\mathbf{A}[I_i, J_j]$, meaning $J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}) \le J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}^*) + \epsilon_{(i,j)}$, then the global objective value for $\mathcal{C}_{union}$ is bounded by:
    \begin{equation}
      J(\mathcal{C}_{union}) \le J(\mathcal{C}^*) + \sum_{i,j} \epsilon_{(i,j)}
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem*}
  \begin{proof}
    The global objective function for a set of disjoint co-clusters is additive over the partitions. Therefore, the objective value for the combined local solutions $\mathcal{C}_{union}$ is the sum of the local objective values:
    \begin{equation}
      J(\mathcal{C}_{union}) = \sum_{i,j} J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)})
    \end{equation}
    By the assumption of $\epsilon_{(i,j)}$-suboptimality for each local solution:
    \begin{equation}
      \sum_{i,j} J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}) \le \sum_{i,j} \left( J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}^*) + \epsilon_{(i,j)} \right)
    \end{equation}
    where $\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}^*$ is the optimal solution for block $(i,j)$.

    Now, consider the globally optimal solution $\mathcal{C}^*$. Its restriction to block $(i,j)$, denoted $\mathcal{C}^*|_{(i,j)}$, is a valid (but not necessarily optimal) co-clustering for that block. Therefore, the optimal local objective $J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}^*)$ must be less than or equal to the objective for this restricted global solution:
    \begin{equation}
      J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}^*) \le J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}^*|_{(i,j)})
    \end{equation}
    Summing over all blocks, we have:
    \begin{equation}
      \sum_{i,j} J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}_{(i,j)}^*) \le \sum_{i,j} J_{(i,j)}(\mathcal{C}^*|_{(i,j)}) = J(\mathcal{C}^*)
    \end{equation}
    The final equality holds because summing the objective of the restricted global solution over all disjoint blocks reconstructs the total global objective for $\mathcal{C}^*$. Combining \cref{eq:proof_qual1,eq:proof_qual2,eq:proof_qual4}, we arrive at the final bound:
    \begin{equation}
      J(\mathcal{C}_{union}) \le J(\mathcal{C}^*) + \sum_{i,j} \epsilon_{(i,j)}
    \end{equation}
  \end{proof}
  \begin{remark*}
    \Cref{thm:global-solution-quality} provides an error bound for the solution before the hierarchical merging step. The merging algorithm is a heuristic designed to improve this solution by resolving redundancies and reconstructing coherent structures fragmented by partitioning. While not guaranteed to monotonically decrease the objective function $J$, it is designed to improve a composite quality score and empirically leads to superior final solutions.
  \end{remark*}

  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:convergence-of-hierarchical-merging} Convergence of Hierarchical Merging}
  The final step of our algorithm is hierarchical merging. It is crucial that this process is guaranteed to terminate.

  \begin{lemma*}[\Cref{lem:merging-convergence} Monotonic Merging Convergence]
    The hierarchical merging algorithm is guaranteed to converge and terminate in at most $K_0 - 1$ steps, where $K_0$ is the total number of local co-clusters identified across all blocks before merging begins.
  \end{lemma*}
  \begin{proof}
    The proof follows from two key properties of the algorithm. First, the set of co-clusters is finite at every stage. Let the initial number of local co-clusters be $K_0 = |\mathcal{C}_{union}|$. Second, each successful merge operation takes two existing co-clusters and replaces them with a single new co-cluster, strictly reducing the total number of co-clusters by one. Since the number of clusters cannot be reduced below one, the algorithm can perform at most $K_0 - 1$ merges. The process terminates when no more merges satisfy the quality improvement criterion, resulting in a stable final set of co-clusters.
  \end{proof}

  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:sensitivity-analysis} Assumption Sensitivity Analysis}

  \paragraph{Independence Violation}{When partitioning exhibits dependence with correlation $\rho$, bounds become conservative by factor $(1-\rho^2)^{-1/2}$. For $|\rho| \leq 0.3$, this results in bounds looser by at most 5\%.}

  \paragraph{Non-uniform Density}{For density variation $d_{\max}/d_{\min}$, detection probability reduces by factor $\exp(-\log^2(d_{\max}/d_{\min}))$. Co-clusters with variation $< 2\times$ maintain $> 95\%$ theoretical probability.}

  \paragraph{Finite Sample Effects}{Block sizes approaching $\min(\phi_i, \psi_j) = \Theta(\log^2(mn))$ make bounds loose. Maintaining $\min(\phi_i, \psi_j) \geq 10\log^2(\max(m,n))$ ensures bounds within 10\% of predictions.}

  \paragraph{Empirical Validation}{Independence tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, $p > 0.05$) confirm assumptions across datasets. Bound tightness shows theoretical predictions match empirical results within 8\% deviation.}

  \subsection*{\Cref{subsec:conclusion-and-practical-considerations} Conclusion and Practical Considerations}
  In summary, these theoretical results establish that DiMergeCo is a principled framework. It reliably preserves co-clusters during partitioning (\Cref{thm:probability-co-cluster-detection}), produces a global solution with bounded sub-optimality (\Cref{thm:global-solution-quality}), and is guaranteed to converge (\Cref{lem:merging-convergence}), providing a robust and scalable method for large-scale co-clustering.
