  abstract   = {Co-clustering methods make use of the correlation between samples and attributes to explore the co-occurrence structure in data. These methods have played a significant role in gene expression analysis, image segmentation, and document clustering. In bipartite graph partition-based co-clustering methods, the relationship between samples and attributes is described by constructing a diagonal symmetric bipartite graph matrix, which is clustered by the philosophy of spectral clustering. However, this not only has high time complexity but also the same number of row and column clusters. In fact, the number of categories of rows and columns often changes in the real world. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel fast flexible bipartite graph model for the co-clustering method (FBGPC) that directly uses the original matrix to construct the bipartite graph. Then, it uses the inflation operation to partition the bipartite graph in order to learn the co-occurrence structure of the original data matrix based on the inherent relationship between bipartite graph partitioning and co-clustering. Finally, hierarchical clustering is used to obtain the clustering results according to the set relationship of the co-occurrence structure. Extensive empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposed model and verify the faster performance, generality, and flexibility of our model.},

However, the existing NMTF-based methods usually involve intensive matrix multiplications, which exhibits a major limitation of high computational complexity. With the explosion at both the size and the feature dimension of texts, there is a growing need to develop a parallel and scalable NMTF-based algorithm for text data co-clustering. To this end, we first show in this paper how to theoretically derive the original optimization problem of NMTF by introducing the Lagrangian multipliers. Then, we propose to solve the Lagrange dual objective function in parallel through an efficient distributed implementation. Extensive experiments on five benchmark corpora validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our distributed parallel update algorithm for an NMTF-based text data co-clustering method.},

  abstract   = {Co-clustering has emerged to be a powerful data mining tool for two-dimensional co-occurrence and dyadic data. However, co-clustering algorithms often require significant computational resources and have been dismissed as impractical for large data sets. Existing studies have provided strong empirical evidence that expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms (e.g., k-means algorithm) with sequential updates can significantly reduce the computational cost without degrading the resulting solution. Motivated by this observation, we introduce sequential updates for alternate minimization co-clustering (AMCC) algorithms which are variants of EM algorithms, and also show that AMCC algorithms with sequential updates converge. We then propose two approaches to parallelize AMCC algorithms with sequential updates in a distributed environment. Both approaches are proved to maintain the convergence properties of AMCC algorithms. Based on these two approaches, we present a new distributed framework, Co-ClusterD, which supports efficient implementations of AMCC algorithms with sequential updates. We design and implement Co-ClusterD, and show its efficiency through two AMCC algorithms: fast nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (FNMTF) and information theoretic co-clustering (ITCC). We evaluate our framework on both a local cluster of machines and the Amazon EC2 cloud. Empirical results show that AMCC algorithms implemented in Co-ClusterD can achieve a much faster convergence and often obtain better results than their traditional concurrent counterparts.},

In this paper, we discuss an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly different methods - in particular, a general weighted kernel k-means objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph clustering objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods such as Metis have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis, and gene network analysis.},

Biclustering allows clustering of rows and columns of a dataset simultaneously. It extracts more accurate information from sparse datasets. In recent years, biclustering has found many useful applications in different fields and many biclustering algorithms have been proposed. Using both row and column information of data, biclustering requires the optimization of two conflicting objectives. In this study, a new multi-objective evolutionary biclustering framework using SPEA2 is proposed. A heuristic local search based on the gene and condition deletion and addition is added into SPEA2 and the best bicluster is selected using a new quantitative measure that considers both its coherence and size. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using simulated and gene expression data and compared with several well-known biclustering methods. The experimental results demonstrate better performance with respect to the size and MSR of detected biclusters and significant enrichment of detected genes.},

Regarding the algorithms as attempting to bi-partition a weighted graph with N vertices, our derivation indicates that they are inherently tuned to tolerate all partitions into two non-empty sets, independently of the cardinality of the two sets. This approach also helps to explain the difference in behaviour observed between methods based on the unnormalized and normalized graph Laplacian. We also give a direct explanation of why Laplacian eigenvectors beyond the Fiedler vector may contain fine-detail information of relevance to clustering. We show numerical results on synthetic data to support the analysis. Further, we provide examples where normalized and unnormalized spectral clustering is applied to microarray data---here the graph summarizes similarity of gene activity across different tissue samples, and accurate clustering of samples is a key task in bioinformatics.},

  abstract   = {Global analyses of RNA expression levels are useful for classifying genes and overall phenotypes. Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find ``marker genes'' that are differentially expressed in particular sets of ``conditions.'' We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive ``checkerboard'' patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).},

In this regard, identification of merits and demerits in the existing methods used to realize recommender systems is to be given paramount importance. In this paper, we review literature to ascertain useful facts pertaining to different approaches to make recommender systems.

  abstract   = {Dyadic data matrices, such as co-occurrence matrix, rating matrix, and proximity matrix, arise frequently in various important applications. A fundamental problem in dyadic data analysis is to find the hidden block structure of the data matrix. In this paper, we present a new co-clustering framework, block value decomposition(BVD), for dyadic data, which factorizes the dyadic data matrix into three components, the row-coefficient matrix R, the block value matrix B, and the column-coefficient matrix C. Under this framework, we focus on a special yet very popular case -- non-negative dyadic data, and propose a specific novel co-clustering algorithm that iteratively computes the three decomposition matrices based on the multiplicative updating rules. Extensive experimental evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this framework as well as the specific algorithms for co-clustering, and in particular, for discovering the hidden block structure in the dyadic data.动态数据矩阵，如共同发生矩阵、评级矩阵和接近矩阵，在各种重要应用中经常出现。动态数据分析的一个基本问题是找到数据矩阵的隐藏块结构。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的协同聚类框架，即针对动态数据的块值分解（BVD），它将动态数据矩阵分解为三个部分，即行系数矩阵R、块值矩阵B和列系数矩阵C。在这个框架下，我们专注于一个特殊但非常流行的情况--非负的动态数据，并提出了一个具体的新型共聚算法，该算法基于乘法更新规则，迭代计算三个分解矩阵。广泛的实验评估也证明了这一框架以及共同聚类的具体算法的有效性和潜力，特别是在发现动态数据中的隐藏块结构方面。},

  abstract   = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

While promising, we demonstrate that existing approaches struggle (in terms of both quality and content) to generate justifications that are relevant to users' decision-making process. We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address this recommendation justification task. In terms of data, we first propose an `extractive' approach to identify review segments which justify users' intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct largescale personalized recommendation justification datasets. In terms of generation, we design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justifications covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justifications based on templates extracted from justification histories. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets which show that our model is capable of generating convincing and diverse justifications.},

Compared with the classical clustering algorithms, co-clustering algorithms have been shown to be more effective in discovering hidden clustering structures in the data matrix. The complexity of previous co-clustering algorithms is usually O(m {\texttimes} n), where m and n are the numbers of rows and columns in the data matrix respectively. This limits their applicability to data matrices involving a large number of columns and rows. Moreover, some huge datasets can not be entirely held in main memory during co-clustering which violates the assumption made by the previous algorithms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for fast co-clustering large datasets, CRD. By utilizing recently developed sampling-based matrix decomposition methods, CRD achieves an execution time linear in m and n. Also, CRD does not require the whole data matrix be in the main memory. We conducted extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data. Compared with previous co-clustering algorithms, CRD achieves competitive accuracy but with much less computational cost.},

The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches.

  abstract   = {Given an affinity graph of data samples, graph-based clustering aims to partition these samples into disjoint groups based on the affinities, and most previous works are based on spectral clustering. However, two problems among spectral-based methods heavily affect the clustering performance. First, the randomness of post-processing procedures, such as KK-means, affects the stability of clustering. Second, the separated stages of spectral-based methods, including graph construction, spectral embedding learning, and clustering decision, lead to mismatched problems. In this paper, we explore a structured graph learning (SGL) framework that aims to fuse these stages to improve clustering stability. Specifically, SGL adaptively learns a structured affinity graph that contains exact kk connected components. Each connected component corresponds to a cluster so clustering assignments can be directly obtained according to the connectivity of the learned graph. In this way, SGL avoids the randomness brought by reliance on traditional post-processing procedures. Meanwhile, the graph construction and structured graph learning procedures happen simultaneously, which alleviates the mismatched problem effectively. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the involved optimization problems and discuss the connections between this work and previous works. Numerical experiments on several synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract   = {Co-clustering partitions instances and features simultaneously by leveraging the duality between them and it often yields impressive performance improvement over traditional clustering algorithms. The recent development in learning deep representations has demonstrated the advantage in extracting effective features. However, the research on leveraging deep learning frameworks for co-clustering is limited for two reasons: 1) current deep clustering approaches usually decouple feature learning and cluster assignment as two separate steps, which cannot yield the task-specific feature representation; 2) existing deep clustering approaches cannot learn representations for instances and features simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for co-clustering called DeepCC. DeepCC utilizes the deep autoencoder for dimension reduction, and employs a variant of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to infer the cluster assignments. A mutual information loss is proposed to bridge the training of instances and features. DeepCC jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model in an end-to-end fashion on both the instance and the feature spaces, which can help the deep autoencoder escape from local optima and the mixture model circumvent the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, DeepCC is the first deep learning model for co-clustering. Experimental results on various dataseis demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepCC.},

In these methods, a coherent pattern corresponds to a low-rank matrix or tensor and can be represented as an intersection of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space. We can then extract coherent patterns from the large data array by detecting hyperplanes.

In such a problem, a widely employed assumption is that of a simple common component shared among multiple graphs. However, in practice, a more intricate topological pattern, comprising simultaneously of homogeneous and heterogeneous components, would exhibit in multiple graphs. In this paper, we propose a general graph estimator based on a novel structural fusion regularization that enables us to jointly learn multiple graphs with such complex topological patterns, and enjoys rigorous theoretical guarantees. Specifically, in the proposed regularization term, the structural similarity among graphs is characterized by a Gram matrix, which enables us to flexibly model different types of network structural similarities through different Gram matrix choices. Algorithmically, the regularization term, coupling the parameters together, makes the formulated optimization problem intractable, and thus, we develop an implementable algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. Theoretically, non-asymptotic statistical analysis is provided, which precisely characterizes the minimum sample size required for the consistency of the graph estimator. This analysis also provides high-probability bounds on the estimation error as a function of graph structural similarities and other key problem parameters. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulated and real data examples.},

Although recent advances in graph convolutional networks have shown the effectiveness of graph convolution in combining structural and content information, there is limited understanding of how to properly apply it for attributed graph clustering. Previous methods commonly use a fixed and low order graph convolution, which only aggregates information of few-hop neighbours and hence cannot fully capture the cluster structures of diverse graphs. In this paper, we first propose an adaptive graph convolution method (AGC) for attributed graph clustering, which exploits high-order graph convolutions to capture global cluster structures and adaptively selects an appropriate order kk via intra-cluster distance. While AGC can find a reasonable kk and avoid over-smoothing, it is not sensitive to the gradual decline of clustering performance as kk increases. To search for a better kk, we further propose an improved adaptive graph convolution method (IAGC) that not only observes the variation of intra-cluster distance, but also considers the inconsistencies of filtered features with graph structure and raw features, respectively. We establish the validity of our methods by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets.},

  abstract   = {Multi-view co-clustering, which clustering the two dimensions of samples and features of multi-view data at the same time, has attracted much attention in recent years. It aims to exploit the duality of multi-view data to get better clustering results. However, most of the existing multi-view co-clustering algorithms consider the sample-feature information of the data while ignoring the sample-sample, feature-feature information, and thus cannot fully mine the potential information contained in the data. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-view co-clustering based on multi-similarity. In particular, based on spectral clustering, we propose a method of constructing graph to improve the performance of clustering, which is no longer limited to the relevance between samples and features. At the same time, inspired by the ensemble algorithm, we use multiple co-clustering algorithms to calculate the similarity information of each view data, which makes the algorithm more robust. Compared with the existing multi-view co-clustering methods, the proposed algorithm exploits the more comprehensive similarity information in each view data, including sample-sample, feature-feature, and sample-feature similarity information. We performed experiments on several benchmark datasets. Due to mining and using more similarity information, our experimental results are better than the comparison method in the three evaluation indicators. In particular, on some data with co-occurrence features such as (word-document), our algorithm achieves better results and can obtain higher accuracy.},
