\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiment}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

This section presents the empirical evaluation of the proposed Probabilistic Ensemble Co-Clustering Method. The experiments aim to assess the method's performance in terms of efficiency, scalability, and accuracy when applied to large data matrices.

\subsection{Datasets}

The experiments were conducted using three distinct datasets to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Amazon 1000: Comprising 1000 Amazon reviews, each represented as a 1000-dimensional vector, this dataset is designed to mimic customer behavior analysis.
    \item CLASSIC4: Containing 18000 documents from 20 newsgroups, each document is represented as a 1000-dimensional vector, suitable for text analysis and topic discovery.
    \item RCV1-Large: A larger dataset used to test the scalability of our method, it includes a vast array of document vectors for high-dimensional data analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment Settings}
All experiments were performed on a computing cluster with the following specifications: Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 @ 2.30GHz processors, 128GB RAM, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system. The algorithms were implemented in rust and compiled with the latest stable version of the rust compiler. 

\subsection{Methodology}
The experiments followed the procedure outlined in Algorithm \ref{alg:method}. The proposed method was compared with the following state-of-the-art co-clustering methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectral Co-Clustering (SCC)
    \item Deep Co-Clustering (DeepCC)
    \item Parallel Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (PNMTF)
    \item Partitioned Spectral Co-Clustering (P-SCC)
    \item Partitioned Parallel Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (P-PNMTF)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
The effectiveness of the co-clustering was measured using two widely accepted metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Normalized Mutual Information (NMI): Quantifies the mutual information between the co-clusters obtained and the ground truth, normalized to [0, 1] range, where 1 indicates perfect overlap.
    \item Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): Adjusts the Rand Index for chance, providing a measure of the agreement between two clusterings, with values ranging from -1 (complete disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
The results of the experiments are summarized in Table \ref{tab:running-time} and Table \ref{tab:evaluation-metrics}. The proposed method outperformed the comparison methods in terms of efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, as evidenced by the running time and evaluation metrics.

The results demonstrate the proposed method's ability to efficiently handle large-scale datasets without compromising the quality of co-cluster identification. The method's adaptability to different data characteristics and its capacity for parallel processing make it a promising candidate for applications in text analysis, biomedical data analysis, and financial pattern recognition.

In conclusion, the experiments validate that the Probabilistic Ensemble Co-Clustering Method is an efficient and accurate approach for analyzing large data matrices. The method's innovative partitioning strategy and ensemble clustering technique offer a new direction for scalable and precise co-clustering in data analysis.
